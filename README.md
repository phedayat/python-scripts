# python-scripts

## Purpose

As I write more Python scripts, I'll add them here.
They're nothing impressive or groundbreaking, just simple scripts that allow me
to work on my Python and general programming skills.

## Scripts

# spaceMaker.py

Meant to put spaces and commas between digits of a long number. I used it as
part of a Project Euler problem I was working on in Java. Basically I wanted
to test my code and needed a lot of numbers, so I decided to generate a random
1000 digit number and use spaceMaker to add commas and spaces to evaluate each
digit separately.

# turt.py

I originally wrote this as part of an interview. Used it again later to begin
teaching a friend of mine Python. I started toying around with it and have been
getting some cool results. Currently, it uses some basic geometry to create
stars with n points.

    * n ≤ 2 creates a line
    * n = 3 creates a triangle
    * n = 4 creates a square
    * n ≥ 5 creates stars with n points
